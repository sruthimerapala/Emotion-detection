<p>Dynamic HyerText Markup Language (DHTML) is a combination of Web development technologies used to create dynamically changing websites. Web pages may include animation, dynamic menus and text effects. The technologies used include a combination of HTML, JavaScript or VB Script,
CSS and the document object model (DOM).</p>
<p>DHTML has the ability to change a webpages look, content and style once the document has loaded on our demand without changing or deleting everything already existing on the browserâ€™s webpage. DHTML can change the content of a webpage on demand without the browser having to erase everything else, i.e. being able to alter changes on a webpage even after the document has completely loaded.</p>
